# Voicepark project
##Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, currently only detectable when motor symptoms appear, that is to say once 70\% of dopaminergic neurons are destroyed. However, the analysis of voice is one method allowing to detect a Parkinsonian at an earlier stage. Our project focuses on distinguishing, by acoustic analysis, between two groups of patients : healthy control and patients suffering from Parkinsonan syndrome. We analized data from 76 subjects, 37 healthy patients and 40 Parkinsonians, performing a recording task : the sustained vowel /a/. In particular, we used a set of features extracted from these samples. We performed supervised learning associated with Monte-Carlo cross validation method for the prediction. Finally, we computed the accuracy, either the rate of well classified subjects to check the reliability of the different algorithms. The best result showed an accuracy of 90\% using Random Forests. To extend our study, we measured the performance of different classifiers to differentiate between parkinsonian syndromes PD, PSP  (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy) and MSA (Multiple System Atrophy).
